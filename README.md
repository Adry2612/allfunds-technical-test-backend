# ALLFUNDS BACKEND TECHNICAL TEST 

This is the repository from the technical test by Allfunds. The backend is made using Node.js, Express and Mongodb.


# How to install in local machine

First step is clone the fronted code in our local machine. This repository is public, so don't need additional authentication.

    git clone https://github.com/Adry2612/allfunds-technical-test-backend.git

## Install the required dependencies

To install all the dependencies, it is necessary to access the cloned folder of the project and type in the terminal the next command:

    npm install

## Run local server

When all the dependencies are installed, we run the next command to run the local server.

    npm start

This open the backend in the port 3700 in your localhost.

# Important

When you open in localhost the project, you can receive data in the frontend correctly. On the frontend there are two main branches. One called main and other one called deployed. The **main branch** contains the code to run the project with the local backend side of the project.
**Deployed branch** is prepared to access to a deployed backend of this code on Hereku.
This branch is good to see the entire app working on the frontend.
